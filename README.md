# about the project 2 forcmpm121

this project is about lights and particles in unity
I decided to create a new scene and not continue from project 1 to better demonstrate the lights and particle effects

## lights in the scene

candles - point lights
chandelier - spotlight
book - area light
sun- directional light

## lightning transition

day-to- night cycle with directional light
referenced this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQCYT_WMzN8&ab_channel=ErenMakesGames)
used animation for transformation along the x axis and color change across time to simulate day cycle

## particles

2s texture emitter and 3d mesh emitter from [procedural fire](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/fire-explosions/procedural-fire-141496)
refereced the asset and created my own emmisive material 3d mesh emitter for candle ashes

## cohesive scene

theme of enchanted room
glass material from [ice shader](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/ice-shader-tutorial-91432)
room asset from [medieval room](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/free-medieval-room-131004)
chair from [old classical chair](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/old-classical-chair-46865)

experimented with terain tool 
used books from [QA books](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/qa-books-115415) for tree generation
used grass blade model from [stylized grass](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/smm-stylized-grass-184975) for grass generation
used [terrain sample asset pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/terrain-sample-asset-pack-145808) for terrain physics
